# Surfing-Board-Purchase

This program asks the user to enter a option (S= usage instruction, T= Transactions, C = view orders, P=order, Q = exit) and if the user presses 'P', it then prompts the user to enter the quantity and size of the surfing board they want, which is saved on file so even if they order using the 'P' option multiple time, once they press 'T' or the transaction button, it will show all of the previous transactions and the total cost of them combined.
